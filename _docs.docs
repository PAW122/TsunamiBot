# Discord auth url update:
if possible swap data insaid of link instead of pasting new link from discord dev page - its not going to work out of the box

example:
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=928399458570502155&response_type=token&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fsenko.tsunamistudio.net%2F&scope=identify+guilds+email
